A TCP server to receive messages managed by a http server.

## Install ðŸ¤˜

The following steps covers the setup process

### Using pyenv with pyenv-virtualenv

You also should use virtualenv to build/develop the project and I recommend the use of [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) with [pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv) to manage multiple python environments.

```bash
pyenv install 3.9.7
pyenv virtualenv 3.9.7 tcp_receiver
pyenv activate tcp_receiver
```

### Installing dependencies (Python 3.9.7)

Open your bash and run the follow command to install all the project dependencies, you just need to run the command one time

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
