A TCP server to receive messages managed by a http server.

## [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/cameritelabs/oci-emulator)

tcp-receiver is available on dockerhub. To run it, just execute:

```bash
docker run -d -p 9950:9950 -p 9528:9528 cameritelabs/tcp-receiver:latest
```

The TCP Server will be available on port 9950 while the HTTP Server will be available on port 9528.

Use the route `GET /get_messages` to get all sent messages to the TCP server.

Use the route `GET /pop_message` to get the first sent message and removed it from the server memory.

Use the route `GET /reset_messages` to remove all messages from the memory and reset it to the initial state.

## Install ðŸ¤˜

The following steps covers the setup process

### Using pyenv with pyenv-virtualenv

You also should use virtualenv to build/develop the project and I recommend the use of [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) with [pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv) to manage multiple python environments.

```bash
pyenv install 3.9.7
pyenv virtualenv 3.9.7 tcp_receiver
pyenv activate tcp_receiver
```

### Installing dependencies (Python 3.9.7)

Open your bash and run the follow command to install all the project dependencies, you just need to run the command one time

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
